2/3/23 - Haynes-Shockley Experiment
Role: Computational Physicist

To-Do:
Make a simulation of 1D electron random-walk //done
Prove random-walk = diffusion //done
Simulate 1D charge carrier diffusion across time //done
Do above with drift //done
Do above with recombination
Simulate 2D decaying charge carrier diffusion across time


Recombination:
Ask Theo to determine the equation for time dependent decay, N(t) //done, give him until Monday
