# The-Haynes-Shockley-Experiment

This is a group project that, as of 6/3/23, I am working on with my group. The aim of this project is to understand the motion of minority charge carriers in locally p-type silicon semiconductors. I am the computational physicist in this project; I produce simulations on what our results should look like, as well as predict what they would look like in extreme cases.
